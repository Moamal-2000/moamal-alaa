          Hello! I'm Moamal, a front-end developer with a passion for creating
          beautiful, functional, and accessible web experiences. I specialize in
          building responsive, performant, and accessible user interfaces that
          leave a lasting impression.
        </p>

        <p>
          My approach combines technical expertise with a keen eye for design,
          ensuring that every project I work on is visually appealing,
          user-friendly, and technically sound. I believe in writing clean,
          maintainable code, staying up-to-date with the latest web technologies
          and best practices, and optimizing for technical SEO. Additionally,
          I'm committed to creating accessible web experiences that are
          inclusive for all users.
        </p>

        <p>Here are a few technologies Iâ€™ve been working with recently:</p>
